# ⏱️ **NEW FEATURE: CUSTOM TIMER SYSTEM**

## ✨ **OVERVIEW**

Per your request, I have implemented a fully customizable **Timer & Break System**. You are no longer restricted to the default 25/5 minute sessions.

---

## ⚙️ **HOW IT WORKS**

1.  **Open Settings:** Click the **Settings (⚙️)** icon in the timer controls.
2.  **Adjust Durations:**
    -   **🎯 Focus Time:** Slide to set between **5 minutes** and **60 minutes**.
    -   **☕ Break Time:** Slide to set between **1 minute** and **30 minutes**.
3.  **Save:** Click **"Save Configuration"**.
    -   The timer effectively resets to your new custom time immediately.
    -   Your settings are **saved automatically** to your device (Local Storage), so they persist even if you refresh the page.

## 🎨 **PREMIUM UI ADDITIONS**

-   **Settings Modal:** A beautiful glassmorphism modal with smooth animations.
-   **Custom Sliders:** Designed "Premium Range Sliders" with:
    -   Custom thumb handles with shadow and border.
    -   Smooth sliding track.
    -   Hover scaling effects.
    -   Tick marks for reference (5m, 30m, 60m).

## 🛠️ **FILES UPDATED**

-   `src/pages/Timer.jsx` - Added settings state, local storage logic, and modal UI.
-   `src/premium-pages.css` - Added styles for the premium range sliders.

**Enjoy your personalized productivity sessions!** 🚀
